## Installation
0. Have julia installed https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KsymenaPoradzisz/AccretionCurrentsJulia
   cd AccretionCurrentsJulia
   ```
2. Activate the project in Julia
   ```bash
   julia --project=.
   ```
3. In Julia REPL install required packages by typing:
    ```
    ] instantiate
   ```
## Usage
# Obtaining visualisation for Schwarzschild black hole
1.Firstly, one have to generate data for flows. To do so, run: in terminal
```bash
 julia Schwarzschild.jl
```
Then insert values for beta, velocity and the size of the animation. All these numbers should be passed as Float64 (so no 1/2, strings and so on)
2. After generating data one should have obtain a file named with a pattern: 'data_Schw_beta_$(Î²)_v_$(v)_dim_$(a_box)_$(timestamp_for_file).csv' in the working directory
3. To generate animation, run in terminal:
```bash
julia Visualisation.jl
```
There are two options of creating animations. One can do them with static streamlines or with dynamic (also called fading/vanishing) streamlines. Program wil ask you which one you want to obtain. 
s - static; d- dynamic; b - both.
4. When the code finish running you should obtain both *.mp4 and *.gif file with your visualisation. Enjoy :)

## Results
   
The result of Schwarzschild visualisation with fading/vanishing streamlines is presented below

For the sake of paper version of my master thesis and for pdf readers who are not capable of presenting animations correctly, the versions with constant streamlines were made and are visible below
